Assignment #6

Programing part:
tested consistently 
all nearest neighbor running time for graphs 2-8 appear to run undetectable
to test running time, i’ve changed multiplied the equations in Display.java by a 1000 
for the purposes of testing only, the values i’m providing are then 1/1000 of a millisecond:
N:           2,    3,    4,    5,   6,   7,    8
nNgh avg:  132,  209,  261,  438, 322, 256,  298 
BruF avg:  115,  157,  282, 1751,3542,4569, 12304
The brute force running time becomes very costly with larger number of vertices
